# web-design-challenge
For this challenge, I created a visualization dashboard using plots from a previous project. The dashboard is a website which starts on a landing page that summarizes the project. The landing page has a navigtion bar at the top for accessing the visualizations and the raw data. It also has a side panel which previews the 4 visualizations. There are four visualization pages for viewing the 4 different plots. These plots consist of climate conditions (temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed) versus the latitude at which the conditions were measured. There is also a comparisons page which allows the user to view all 4 plots on the same screen. Finally, the data page contains a table of the raw data used to make the plots. 

I am currently having issues hosting my website on github.io. Please download the files and launce the website using Live Server (via Visual Studio Code) to ensure proper functionality. I am working to resolve the issue with github.io.
